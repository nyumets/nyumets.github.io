title: NYUMets
subtitle: Understanding Metastatic Cancer
---

NYUMets is an attempt to advance our collective understanding of metastatic (Stage IV) cancer with
data science. Metastatic cancer is a devastating and complex illness, and one of the greatest challenges in treating it
is measuring cancer in its full, real-world complexity as it evolves over time: clinically, radiographically, molecularly, and genetically.<br> <br>

Data science starts with data. We believe that by studying and releasing massive, open, longitudinal, real world datasets of metastatic cancer
that we can facilitate new understanding of this disease and how it impacts patients.
This research project housed at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine at NYU and the NYU Center for Data Science brings together a diverse team of 
physicians, scientists, staff, students all with the goal of using "data science" to better characterize and understand metastatic cancer.
