Metastatic cancer is one of the most feared and lethal diseases. One of the greatest challenges with studying it, and treating it, is the shear complexity of the disorder with the possibility for hundreds of metastatic lesions to numerous organs with each lesion causing variable symptoms and potentially bearing thousands of mutations - and having the capability of dynamically changing over time and in response to therapies and environmental pressures. Better tools for observing, analyzing, and understanding metastatic cancer are essential, and we believe that the techniques of modern data science are up to the task. NYUMets is our initiative to share data, tools, and insights with the greater scientific community to hopefully find new ways of studying and eventually treating metastatic cancer.
