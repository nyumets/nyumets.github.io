title: NYUMets
subtitle: Understanding Metastatic Cancer
---

NYUMets is an attempt to advance the science and care of metastatic (Stage IV) cancer through open data science.
Metastatic cancer is a devastating and complex illness, and one of the greatest challenges in treating it
is measuring the dynamics of cancer in its full, real-world complexity as it evolves over time: clinically, radiographically, molecularly, and genetically.<br> <br>

Data science starts with data. We believe that by studying and making available massive, open, longitudinal, real-world datasets of metastatic cancer
that we can facilitate new understanding of metastatic cancer both scientifically and clinically and ultimately improve how we take care of patients.
This research initiative is housed at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine at NYU and the NYU Center for Data Science, and  brings together a diverse team of 
physicians, scientists, staff, students all with the goal of using "data science" to better characterize and understand metastatic cancer. We are incredibly grateful to our
collaborators at nVidia Inc. and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their ongoing support, and all of us look forward to sharing our work and growing this initiative in the coming years. <br> <br>
