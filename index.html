title: NYUMets
subtitle: Understanding Metastatic Cancer
---

NYUMets is a research project housed at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine at
NYU that brings together a diverse team of physicians, scientists, staff, students
all with the goal of using "data science" to better characterize and understand metastatic cancer.
Metastatic cancer is a devastating illness, and one of the greatest challenges in treating it
is simply observing it in its full complexity: clinically, radiographically, molecularly, genetically.
This incredibly high dimensional problem, to be properly studied, requires large datasets up to the task.
Our hypothesis is that by making publicly available massive datasets of metastatic cancer, with the help
of other researchers across the globe, we may facilitate a new, open source way of attempting to know, understand,
and treat this devastating illness. To begin enabling the research community, NYU Langone Health
is releasing this fully anonymized clinical and radiographic datasets as NYUMets v1.0, to be followed
by subsequent releases of clinical, radiographic, and genetic information for other types of cancer.

For our initial release, we have targeted a rare but devastating subtype of metastatic cancer: metastatic brain cancer.
